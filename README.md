# hybrid-linked-list
The program stores blacklisted credit cards organized according to their expiration dates. The program uses a hybrid data structure that contains both Doubly Linked List and Singly Linked Lists. The expiration dates are stored in a Doubly Linked List, while the credit card numbers are stored in Singly Linked Lists connected to the nodes of the doubly linked list according to the expiration dates. Thus, the data structure is a hybrid and kind of two-dimensional one. Furthermore, credit card numbers may not be unique, and credit cards numbers are stored in a sorted fashion (smaller to larger). The program will read data from a file as a menu option.
